<h4 id="ccc1">The National Park Handbook Series</h4>
<p>National Park Handbooks, compact introductions
    to the great natural and historic places administered
    by the National Park Service, are designed
    to promote understanding and enjoyment of the
    parks. Each is intended to be informative reading
    and a useful guide before, during, and after a park
    visit. More than 100 titles are in print. This is
    Handbook 111. You may purchase the handbooks
    through the mail by writing to Superintendent of
    Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
    Washington DC 20402.</p>
<h4 id="ccc2">About This Book</h4>
<p>Devils Tower National Monument is in the Black
    Hills of northeastern Wyoming. The major attractions
    are the volcanic rock Tower and protected
    prairie dog communities. This handbook is published
    in support of the National Park Service’s
    management policies and interpretive programs at
    the park. Part 1 of the handbook gives a brief introduction
    to the park and its history; Part 2 takes
    a close look at the area’s natural history and, in
    particular, prairie dogs; and Part 3 presents concise
    travel guide and reference materials.</p>

<p>Devils Tower rises dramatically and abruptly out
    of the Black Hills above the Belle Fourche River
    in northeastern Wyoming. These Black Hills are
    an island in the Great Plains, the heart of the
    American West. The aura of this West and of its
    history, folklore, and legend is a fondly nurtured
    American treasure. Never just The West, it is
    rather the Scenic West, or the Old West, or the
    True West, and of course the Wild West. Each
    epithet suggests that no one can pay homage to
    the region without resorting to its curious mixture
    of the known and the unknown, of truth and
    myth. Here is a land of blue skies, magnificent
    rock formations, and a clear, dry atmosphere that
    easily confuses and distorts your sense of distance.
    It is a land of mountain views, long probing rivers,
    deserts, and high plains and space—great
    unfathomable oceans of space. The West is the
    archetypal outdoors whose recreation possibilities
    forever grip the modern imagination.</p>
<p>A trip to Devils Tower National Monument is a
    trip to Wyoming, a state fully proud of its Western
    traditions. Car license plates display the bucking
    bronco to advertise “the land of the cowboy,” a
    motif repeated in many public places and widely
    observed in the casual manner of its people.</p>
<p>A trip to Devils Tower is also a trip to the Black
    Hills, an island of life rising out of the more arid
    Great Plains. Devils Tower sits on the Black Hills’
    western fringe and is in fact the area’s most
    remarkable landmark. The Tower still evokes the
    mystery of this land where whites feared to travel
    until as late as 1876, the year General George
    Armstrong Custer and his cavalry fought—and
    were annihilated—in the battle of the Little Big
    Horn River in Montana. This last great victory of
    the Sioux and Cheyenne who refused reservation
    life made them hunted outlaws among whites.
    Their relatives on reservations soon gave away the
    tribal lands and with this went the Indians’ last
    hope of remaining free to travel and hunt from
    their revered Black Hills base.</p>
<p>To speak of history in Wyoming is to speak of a
    mere hundred years. Events in the settlement are
    so recent that many residents can recite them as
    part of their family history. Before that are the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
    oral histories of the Sioux, Cheyenne, Shoshone,
    Crow, and other tribes whose dates of occupation
    are but vaguely known.</p>
<p>Gold discoveries in today’s South Dakota
    portion of the Black Hills forced the final clash
    with the plains tribes. Custer had confirmed gold
    reports and the pressure of the excited rush that
    followed broke the government’s earlier treaty
    resolve to preserve forever the Indians’ sovereignty
    over the Black Hills.</p>
<p>Settlers carrying American civilization to the
    West by the overland route to California, Oregon
    Territory, and Mormon Utah then quickly flowed
    into this backwater area. As the frenzied furor
    over Black Hills gold diminished and mines and
    creeks played out, homesteaders settled on lands
    parceled out for ranches. Along the Belle Fourche
    River, where the plains Indian tribes had
    sometimes spent winters, a new era opened under
    this brooding tower of rock called Mateo Tepee.</p>
<p>Place names in the West can be powerfully
    suggestive of history, but they can also be very
    unreliable; Devils Tower for instance. To the
    Indians this singular occurrence of dramatically
    upthrust rock marked the dwelling place of bears,
    hence Mateo Tepee or “Bear Lodge.” Their
    stories told of lost youngsters who were chased by
    a giant bear and climbed on top of a rock in a last
    desperate effort to save themselves. The children
    appealed to the spirits and the rock grew up out of
    the ground to lift the children out of the giant
    bear’s reach. Versions of this story belong to
    different tribes, but most have in common the
    bear’s futile attempt to claw its way to the top.
    This clawing left permanent grooves on the Tower.</p>
<p>Colonel Richard I. Dodge apparently had not
    heard these stories when he entered the Black
    Hills in 1875. In charge of a large military escort
    to a scientific team, he came in violation of Indian
    treaty rights after Custer’s 1874 expedition which had
    reported gold. Dodge noted that his questions to the
    Indians about this “terra incognita” known as
    the Black Hills were met with “studied silence.”
    This only heightened a true explorer’s curiosity.
    Perhaps the Indian scouts affected a calculated
    silence, hoping the whites would leave. When the
    great rock tower first loomed in sight, they told
    <span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
    Dodge it was named, “with proper modification by
    our surveyors,” the Devils Tower. In later years
    few could recall why this name was used.</p>
<p>If it was meant to scare off these white explorers
    and those to follow, it did not. The new wave of
    American settlers did not believe that natural
    objects held supernatural powers. No matter how
    awesome or unusual, science had an explanation
    for everything in nature, or would eventually.
    Devils Tower was determined to be the core of an
    ancient volcano, an obelisk of volcanic trachyte,
    with sides so straight that one “could only look
    upward in despair of ever planting his feet on the
    top,” as one geologist in Dodge’s expedition put it.</p>
<p>The desire to conquer and tame nature, the view
    that men could use up natural things and discard
    them without asking the spirits, differed greatly from
    Indian concepts. While the tools and equipment of
    an advanced civilization could not be resisted, the
    explanation white men gave for their world could
    never satisfy the Indians. How uncomfortable it must
    have been for them when they were asked to relate
    their tribal stories of places such as Mateo Tepee,
    about which there could be no “proof!” One day a
    man would find a way to plant his feet on top of
    Devils Tower, and it would be hailed as a personal
    feat of strength and daring having nothing to do with
    the spirit of the bear that dwelt within his lodge.</p>
<p>In the 20-year period after the opening of the Black
    Hills, cowmen and sheepherders discovered the hilly
    prairies and spacious grasslands that spread from the
    Belle Fourche River as far west as the Big Horn
    Mountains. Cattle trailed up from Texas flourished
    into great herds that freely roamed the open range.
    The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad extended
    its line from Nebraska northwestward to Gillette,
    which quickly became the system’s largest shipping
    point. As many as 12,000 beef cattle and 40,000
    head of sheep at a time waited at the railroad to be
    sent to eastern meatpackers. Wyoming became a
    state in 1890, its history already indelibly colored by
    the cowboy lifestyle and territorial range feuds.</p>
<p>Cowboy songs and stories of Western American
    folklore often mentioned the Belle Fourche River.
    The first ranchers to settle along it established small-scale
    cattle outfits centered about Hulett within sight
    of Devils Tower. These early-day settlers may not
    <span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
    have revered the Tower as the Indians did, but neither
    were they disposed to see it exploited for private
    gain. There was enough feeling to cause Wyoming’s
    Senator Francis E. Warren to introduce into the U.S.
    Senate in July of 1892 a bill to establish Devils Tower
    National Park. Congressional support for the bill fizzled,
    but the General Land Office in Washington
    had already withdrawn from settlement several sections
    of land adjoining the Tower and the Little
    Missouri Buttes to the northwest. Protection of Devils
    Tower was at least temporarily assured.</p>
<p>The same year the park bill failed, two men now
    famous in the history of the West traveled to Devils
    Tower hoping against hope like any other tourists
    that it would match their own expectations. Photographer
    William H. Jackson had been commissioned
    by the State of Wyoming to photograph the State’s
    scenic attractions for the World’s Columbian Exposition
    the next year in Chicago. With him traveled a
    friend, the landscape painter Thomas Moran. Their
    round trip from the railhead at Gillette, by horse-drawn
    wagon lasted four days. Moran described the
    adventure in a magazine article illustrated by his
    drawings, and a Jackson photo of the Tower ended
    up in Chicago. In their one afternoon there, they
    had produced the first widely known visual records
    of Devils Tower.</p>
<p>Jackson and Moran’s unceremonious visit to the
    Tower in 1892 was undoubtedly forgotten in the rush
    of excitement the next year. Homesteaders, ranchers,
    and cowhands and their families flocked in unusual
    numbers to celebrate Independence Day at
    Devils Tower. Handbills called the Tower one of the
    greatest natural wonders in the United States and
    announced that “the rarest sight of a lifetime” would
    be observed at the festivities. The news obviously
    spread far, for more than 1,000 people made the trip.</p>
<p>The ballyhoo surrounded William Rogers. A local
    cowboy, he became, as far as anybody knew, the
    first human being to set foot on top of the Tower.
    He and a climbing partner, Willard Ripley, made the
    ascent by way of a wooden ladder they had worked
    on all that spring for the first 107 meters (350 feet)
    of the Tower. Those who knew the tall and raw-boned
    Rogers said he was never afraid of man or
    devil. After ceremonies on the ground, he and Ripley
    scrambled over the boulder field and started up the
    ladder with the cheers of the crowd presumably ringing
    in their ears. The climb took only an hour, the
    riskiest part of the business having been accomplished
    in the days preceding the event.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>When they reached the top, Rogers and Ripley
    strung up Old Glory from a flagpole they had somehow
    already managed to carry to the top! It was a
    spectacle in which many in the crowd below could
    claim a part. Muslin for the oversized flag apparently
    was purchased in Sundance, Wyoming, where it was
    painted and sewn together by a committee of boosters.
    Someone, it is said, had tailored a patriotic
    climbing suit of red, white, and blue that was presented
    to Rogers at ceremonies before the climb.</p>
<p>Ranchers who witnessed the event said that while
    Rogers may indeed have risked his neck on the
    Tower, he reaped an entrepreneurial bonanza afterwards.
    During the daylong merriment and the dancing
    that evening, his wife and his partner’s wife ran
    the only refreshment stand. The flag, which had
    blown down, was cut up and sold for souvenirs, and
    the ladies made a small fortune. Perhaps the boast
    of the handbill published that year by the Crook
    County Commissioners was true: It was possible to
    have a better time at Devils Tower that summer than
    in Chicago at the World’s Fair.</p>
<p>Rogers and Ripley raised a public spectacle perhaps
    not equalled until the caper of “Devils Tower
    George” Hopkins, the subject of a 1941 Tower-top
    rescue mission by alpinist Jack Durrance. Hopkins
    parachuted to the top and was stranded, keeping
    millions of newspaper readers in suspense over his
    fate atop the isolated rock monument few had ever
    seen. Durrance rescued his man five days later. Devils
    Tower again loomed in the national imagination,
    with the screening of the film “Close Encounters of
    the Third Kind.” And in 1979 a televised sports show
    featured George Willig, the “human fly,” whose
    climbing antics were beamed nationwide via space
    satellite. As we entered the decade of the 1980s the
    number of registered climbs of Devils Tower surpassed
    the 10,000 mark. But that’s jumping ahead
    too quickly in the chronology of this story.</p>
<p>At the turn of the century, the Tower became a
    natural meeting place for people who might see each
    other but once a summer at a Fourth of July celebration.
    Oldtimers recall that a small, rough-cut
    <span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
    wooden platform served as a dance floor; the merry-go-round
    had seats for four children at most; and the
    home-grown orator read the Declaration of Independence.
    The affairs were fun and lasted for days.
    People camped at the Tower, and sometimes those
    who came across the river from the east were
    stranded by a quick summer flood.</p>
<p>In time, the harshness of the frontier softened a
    bit. Towns and cities replaced crude settlements and
    provided secure bases from which to look out at the
    wonders of the land. The newly arrived settlers made
    the West their own. And, to compress time and
    events into a few words, some people began to think
    about protecting some of the uniqueness of the West.</p>
<p>The National Park System owes its existence to
    this dawning of a conservation ethic in the late 19th
    century. Yellowstone, in northwestern Wyoming,
    became the first national park in 1872. A few other
    tracts were set aside as parks in subsequent years,
    but the preservation movement surged in 1906, when
    Congress passed the Antiquities Act. The President
    now had the authority to create national monuments.
    Not only scenery was to remain unspoiled in these
    monuments, but also priceless Indian ruins, pottery,
    and projectiles and other objects of antiquity were
    to be protected from looting collectors. President
    Theodore Roosevelt made conservation a national
    goal and used the Antiquities Act to proclaim the
    first eighteen national monuments. Devils Tower
    National Monument became the first, created on
    September 24, 1906, giving Wyoming both the first
    national park and the first national monument.</p>

<p>The next campaign was for money to build a bridge
    over the Belle Fourche River. By 1916, when the
    local families gathered at the Tower for another July
    Fourth picnic, it seemed that Congress would never
    appropriate money to turn the place into a proper
    public resort. A petition to Wyoming’s Congressman
    Frank W. Mondell complaining about washed out
    trails and difficult access to the Tower was circulated
    among the 1916 picnickers and may have done some
    good. The next year, the newly created National
    Park Service directed the building of an entrance
    road, soon to be improved again for auto traffic. By
    the end of the 1920s Wyoming’s participation in the
    national enthusiasm for highway construction was
    showing results. Old pathways followed by the Sioux,
    later broadened for buckboard wagon and stagecoach,
    were now graded and oiled for motorcars. A
    trip to the West was no longer an expedition of
    months: cross-country motoring had arrived.</p>

<p>Through the Depression years from 1931 to 1941
    the number of tourists, vacationers, and sightseers
    tripled at Devils Tower. And in the meantime, an
    army of unemployed laborers and artisans, organized
    as the Civilian Conservation Corps, applied themselves
    to public works projects throughout the country.
    At last the park received the attention its admirers
    said it deserved. CCC workers built new roads
    over an access bridge only a few years old. Overnight
    campgrounds were landscaped and picnic areas were
    provided with tables and benches. Formal walking
    trails were made for orderly hiking excursions around
    the base of the Tower. Water and electrical systems
    were installed, and in 1935 a museum was built out
    of rough-hewn logs. The museum, filled with exhibits,
    still stands at the foot of Tower Trail and
    serves as a summer visitor center, book sales outlet,
    and registration office for climbers.</p>
<p>Ask the average traveler to Devils Tower for his
    or her impressions and invariably two things come
    to mind, or, more properly, stand tall. One is the
    immutable, immobile Tower; the other is the animated,
    lively prairie dog. The national monument
    has become one of several reserves for this beleaguered
    plains inhabitant, whose communal lifestyle
    is profiled in Part 2 of this handbook. Like the
    Tower, it is misnamed, but so fixed is it in our minds
    and experience that it will likely always remain so.
    Subjected to eradication campaigns throughout the
    plains area because of conflicts with livestock enterprises,
    these otherwise personable rodents are protected
    here at Devils Tower National Monument.</p>
<p>The visitor conveniences that were so long in coming
    to Devils Tower are now enjoyed by nearly
    300,000 persons every year. They come for mid-June’s
    display of wildflowers, or mid-September’s
    fall colors. They come to challenge themselves in the
    tradition of William Rogers and Willard Ripley.
    They come to watch the prairie dogs bustle about in
    near-parody of our own busyness. But most of all
    the Tower inspires a swing-by on the way east or
    west, prompting some travelers to tarry for a day or
    two on this pleasant plainsland.</p>

<h3 id="c4">A Day at Devils Tower</h3>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Pouring a mug of boiled coffee, I wait for the sun
    to make its appearance. The cup steams in the damp,
    cool morning air. Shivering, I press both hands to
    the heat the thick porcelain holds.</p>
<p>The sky begins to purple, and stars dim perceptibly.
    Through the campground cottonwoods, the immense,
    shadow-black bulk of the Tower materializes
    against the sky. It is possible now to discern the flight
    of bats overhead. But, in an instant, their swirling,
    night-long ballet vanishes with the darkness.</p>
<p>From my campsite along the Belle Fourche—this
    narrow, meandering river the French fur trappers
    named “the beautiful branch”—I listen to the first
    sounds of the day. Across the river a great horned
    owl protests the morning’s swift advance. Coming
    through the veil of river fog, its haunting, pervasive
    <i>hoo-hoo-hoooo</i> is enough to freeze the blood of cottontails.</p>
<p>Even before the first hint of light, robins had begun
    to sing softly. In these unhurried morning songs they
    prove themselves thrushes. With the increasing light,
    the growing blend of wren, vireo, and thrasher music
    intensifies. These soft phrasings soon quicken into
    proclamations of territory, and meadowlarks,
    mourning doves, and yellowthroats compete across
    thicket, river, and meadow, their singing seemingly
    sharpened for distance and authority.</p>
<p>Nearby, a cottontail grazes on the dew-bent grass.
    It pauses occasionally, pointing its ears and working
    its nostrils in my direction. Three whitetail deer continue
    their cautious single-file approach, heading
    from the river bottom toward the higher ground of
    the prairie dog town. Crossing the campground, they
    repeatedly stop to inspect their surroundings. A log
    snaps and whistles in my fire, bringing their heads
    about in immediate, almost mechanical unison. Deliberately
    the lead animal lifts its tail to expose its
    white, silent signal of danger, and all three step
    smartly away as if in time to a fast metronome.</p>
<p>Direct sunlight spotlights the Tower. As though
    to challenge the sudden appearance of a gigantic,
    equally yellow competitor, a meadowlark takes wing,
    singing its loud, clear claim over the prairie dog town.
    Dawn is announced, the day begun.</p>
<p>The level rays of the sun accentuate the Tower’s
    vertical polygonal columns. The stark contrast of
    light and shadow imparted by the graceful taperings
    <span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
    of the soaring, many-sided columns give the Tower
    a man-made look. In this light it resembles the ruin
    of a stupendous ancient temple, not the casual result
    of some remote geological event.</p>
<p>Sipping the strong coffee, I wonder at the long
    procession of vanished Indian societies that camped
    and hunted here periodically through the centuries.
    These ancient peoples devised various stories to explain
    such an unusual landmark. And yet what science
    now says about the creation of Devils Tower
    would have seemed to those tribes as fantastic as
    their legends of a gargantuan bear gouging the rock
    seem to us today. Minor uncertainties remain, but
    geologists have pieced together a rough picture of
    the Tower’s probable origin. Some 60 million years
    ago, great Earth stresses began to deform the crust
    of the continent, resulting in the uplifting of the
    Rocky Mountains and Great Plains region. As the
    surface rock layers began to crumple and fault,
    magma from deep inside the Earth welled up into
    many of the resulting gaps and fissures. In many
    places on the continent, spectacular volcanoes formed,
    erupting with explosive force.</p>
<p>As the Rockies were being created, the climate of
    the continent’s interior began to change. The long
    reign of the dinosaurs that had presided over a stable,
    tropical landscape was coming to an end. The climate
    was gradually becoming cooler and drier. Doubtless
    the immense volumes of volcanic ash ejected into
    the atmosphere prevented a percentage of solar heat
    from reaching the Earth. Certainly the rise of the
    Rocky Mountains to the west influenced the old
    weather patterns. As the mountain blocks rose
    higher, they intercepted the warm, moist winds that
    blew inland from the Pacific. With the air masses
    rising ever higher, more and more of the moisture
    that had watered the extensive inland Cretaceous
    forests and swamplands was prevented from reaching
    what we know today as the Great Plains.</p>
<p>Steadily the forests retreated eastward as the “rain
    shadow” cast by the mountains extended eastward,
    shutting off the moist, warm Pacific winds. No longer
    moderated by these winds, the mid-continent was
    increasingly opened to seasonal invasions of northern
    arctic air. Newer ecosystems, such as deserts and
    grasslands, slowly evolved to replace the lush forests
    and swamps that had for so long sustained the dinosaurs.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
    Just as drought, fire, and temperature extremes
    began to alter the old order in the plant kingdom,
    so did the more adaptable mammals and birds
    begin to replace reptiles as dominant animal forms.</p>

    <p class="pcap"><i>Both the Kiowa and Cheyenne
        Indians held similar legends
        on the origin of the Tower.
        The story goes that tribal
        members were surprised by a
        gigantic bear, and their incantations
        caused a low, flat rock
        to rise, lifting them above the
        reach of the bear. The massive
        beast then gouged huge vertical
        marks into the rock as it
        attempted to reach the people.
        Finally, the Indians were able
        to kill the bear.</i></p>
</div>
<p>But not all the magma that welled upward during
    this restless period reached the Earth’s surface. Extensive
    masses were trapped far below the surface,
    where they gradually cooled and congealed. The Missouri
    Buttes and Devils Tower, however, are believed
    to be necks of extinct volcanoes. Geologic
    evidence indicates the Missouri Buttes formed first
    in two separate eruptions. The magma hardened,
    plugging the plumbing underneath. A third eruption
    to the southeast resulted in Devils Tower.</p>
<p>During the ensuing tens of millions of years, the
    gradual erosion of the overlying rock strata revealed
    these intruded plugs of volcanic rock. Since this
    dense, hard igneous rock resists erosion much better
    than the surrounding sedimentary rock, these formations
    will continue to stand out as features.</p>
<p>That ancient land of sedimentary rock through which
    the molten mass of Devils Tower penetrated may at
    one time have been as high as the golden eagle I
    now see drifting high above the Tower. Circling
    slowly in its morning hunt, the eagle spirals upward
    on the currents of warm air rising off the sun-heated
    rock. Perhaps it now soars at the elevation of the
    land long ago when the heavy, ringing-hard rock of
    Devils Tower oozed like paste far below the surface.</p>
<p>Today the top of the Tower is 386 meters (1,267
    feet) above the Belle Fourche River. If that warm,
    Cretaceous landscape rested 600 meters (2,000 feet)
    above the present summit of the Tower, then more
    than 900 vertical meters (3,000 feet) of sedimentary
    rock has been pared away in the last 60 million years.</p>
<p>The relentless physical agents of erosion—running
    water, wind, and frost action—together with chemical
    breakdown of rock particles, continue to alter
    the landform. Given enough time, even the very hard
    rock of the Tower itself will waste away.</p>
<p>Sixty million years ago, when dinosaurs <i>Triceratops</i>
    and <i>Tyrannosaurus Rex</i> duelled beside the lush
    river banks of the predecessor of the Belle Fourche,
    the ancestor of the golden eagle was flying overhead.
    Millions of years hence, a descendant of the eagle
    might soar above this same Wyoming landscape.
    Missing will be the unique shaft of fluted rock we
    call Devils Tower. And what of the men, who for a
    mere eyeblink of time, hunted in its shadow or came
    to wonder at its somber countenance in the morning
    sun?</p>

                sedimentary rocks that make up northeastern Wyoming.
                The mass cooled into a hard, igneous rock called phonolite

<p>A <i>thwack</i> of an ax against wood puts an end to my
    daydreaming. My companion the cottontail hops for
    cover. The pair of magpies that have been feeding
    on the remains of a road-killed ground squirrel flash
    upward to safety. The gradual awakening of campground
    life inspires woodpeckers to hammer in the
    cottonwoods, and a yellow-breasted chat adds its odd
    jibber to the collected noise.</p>
<p>Gathering up knapsack and camera. I start my
    hike to the Tower. Already the sash of river fog has
    lifted and the air warmed to shirtsleeve comfort.
    From somewhere on the red cliffs that gown the
    Tower’s base, the faint singing of a rock wren beckons.
    Ahead lie 13 kilometers (8 miles) of trail, looping
    through a mosaic of sights, sounds, and smells
    of grassland, pine forest, woodland, and river.</p>
<h4 id="ccc4">From Dog Town to Ant Colony</h4>
<p>Leaving the campground, I follow the trail that leads
    through the prairie dog town. The prairie dogs stand
    upright as I approach. The ones nearest the path
    begin their warning call, a monotonous “<i>churk-churk-churk-churk</i>.”
    The closer an intruder comes,
    the lower the animals sink into their holes, and the
    faster and shriller the chant becomes. Finally, with
    a last flick of its nervously twitching tail, each disappears
    into the safety of its burrow.</p>
<p>Prairie dogs, like the bison that once shared their
    vast range, are now reduced to remnant populations.
    Two hundred years ago, there were billions of prairie
    dogs on the shortgrass plains; these large ground
    squirrels had successfully adapted themselves to the
    harsh conditions. Perfect digging machines, they escape
    most predators and the extremes of the weather
    by spending more than half their lives underground.</p>
<p>The prairie dogs near the road do not even bother
    to sound a warning as I approach. They seem to be
    different creatures from the wild, suspicious animals
    farther from the road. Laconic and fat from handouts,
    more curious than cautious, they approach
    rather than retreat. These animals are easier targets
    for the redtail hawk that is screaming above the river
    <span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
    timber, or the golden eagle that sails high overhead.</p>
<p>Across the road, the trail leaves the grassland of the
    prairie dogs and climbs steeply among ponderosa
    pines. Already the sun grows hot. At the edge of the
    forest, I stop to rest and survey the landscape before
    me. Spread out below, and now shimmering with sundance
    heat, the buff-colored dog town stands out in
    stark contrast with its darker, greener surroundings.</p>
<p>Although I sit only 30 meters (100 feet) or so above
    the dog town, I am struck by what my vantage point
    reveals: a clear patchwork of life communities. The
    loop of the Belle Fourche and the June-bright leaves
    of the deciduous trees lining its course provide a
    bright counterpart to the somber, pine-scattered
    ridge beyond. Just a short distance away the ponderosas
    appear more black than green. It was just
    such a quality that gave the distant, pine-covered
    mountain range to the east the name <i>Black</i> Hills.</p>
<p>From where I sit, the lobe of the level bench of
    land that juts into the river looks as if it were graded
    and maintained by man, for its close-cropped vegetation
    contrasts greatly with the rugged ridge beyond.
    But this old floodplain was graded level by the river,
    and prairie dogs, not machines, clip the vegetation.</p>
<p>This small area of grassland, sandwiched between
    the base of the Tower and the encircling river, supports
    a surprising amount of life. Yet from all appearances,
    it would seem as if the multitude of prairie
    dogs would soon denude their patch of land and die
    of starvation. In contrast to the surrounding territory,
    the vegetation of the dog town appears exhausted.</p>
<p>Indeed, today’s empty plains give few hints of what
    a crowded stage the shortgrass plains once was. Before
    the coming of the white man, the grasslands
    teemed with bison, pronghorn, wapiti—named buffalo,
    antelope, and elk respectively by European settlers—and
    sprawling towns of prairie dogs. Astounded
    early observers, accustomed to the lush flora
    of the eastern woodlands, could not imagine how so
    many animals could survive in such a parched-looking
    land.</p>
<p>The secret is the grass itself. Whether tinder dry
    in midsummer or dead in winter, the grass blades
    remain highly nutritious. Grass plants can withstand
    repeated grazing and fires since new growth progresses
    from the stem joints rather than from the tips.</p>

            <p class="pcap">Photographer Galen Rowell and writer Dennis Hanson
                decided to climb the
                Tower in October 1978 to
                find out for themselves what’s
                up there. After a strenuous
                five-hour climb, interrupted
                by occasional clouds of rock
                doves (below), they
                reached the top and found the
                surface is not as flat as it appears
                from down below or
                even from an airplane.
                Besides grasses, they found
                sagebrush, currant, and prickly
                pear cactus (below). As
                they were cooking dinner, a
                wood rat (below) joined them, nibbling
                at their food packets,
                peering into a pot, and nosing
                about their climbing gear.
                They also saw chipmunks and
                plenty of birds (See pages
                <a class="pgref pginternal" href="#Page_44">44</a>-45, <a class="pgref pginternal"
                                                                          href="#Page_60">60</a>-61), but, perhaps
                because of the coolness of
                October, they did not see any
                rattlesnakes, which others
                have found there sometimes.
                How did the animals get to
                the top? Some people have
                speculated that they were
                dropped by predatory birds,
                but that is questionable: they
                probably would have been
                killed by the birds’ talons or
                by the plunge to the surface.
                More than likely they just
                climbed up the Tower’s sides
                and took up residence. Many
                climbers, of the human sort,
                have reported seeing snakes
                and rodents working their

<p>In addition, most plains animals contend with the
    semi-arid conditions of their environment by making
    efficient use of available moisture. Pronghorn, prairie
    dogs, and kangaroo rats, for example, need never
    take a drink since they obtain necessary water from
    the plants they eat. Such plant and animal adaptations
    explain why the shortgrass plains can sustain
    such a vast panorama of life.</p>
<p>From a tall pine upslope, a red squirrel chatters
    with indignation at discovering my intrusion into its
    domain. The bell-like song of a rock wren answers
    from an outcrop nearby. The small gray bird appears
    atop a boulder, motionless but for an instant, then
    hops down to resume its search for insects among
    the bright, arid cliffs it claims for its own.</p>
<p>I realize that I am seeing more than scenery here.
    All around me are boundaries—conspicuous where
    defined by plants, but invisible where respected by
    animals. No prairie dog has ever traveled across this
    slope, and no red squirrel has ever scurried into the
    treeless expanse of the prairie dog town. On no occasion
    would a rock wren enter the deep pine forest.
    Should its food supply somehow vanish, it would
    perish among the bare earth and gully washes of its
    own habitat rather than hunt the dog town or forest
    floor.</p>
<p>Each animal species is adapted to the conditions
    of its preferred environment. The prairie dog and
    red squirrel have similar roles in their respective habitats,
    as do the meadowlark in the grassland, the
    house wren in the deciduous woodlands, the rock
    wren on barren slopes, and the brilliant western tanager
    of the pine forests that is calling “<i>pit-ik, pit-ik,
        pit-ik</i>” from a branch overhead.</p>
<p>Whether herbivore, carnivore, scavenger, or decomposer,
    all of the countless, magnificently varied
    life-forms of each community share in the endless
    flow of chemical energy that originates with the touch
    of sun on chlorophyll. Eagle, prairie dog, bacterium,
    man—we all owe our lives, directly or indirectly, to
    the green leaf’s unique ability to convert light energy
    into chemical energy.</p>
<p>So does this colony of black ants foraging near my
    feet. Back and forth the living lines run, each individual
    obeying its ancient, perfected legacy of instinct.
    One carries aloft the bright green corpse of
    a lacewing. With a little last-minute help from fellow
    <span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
    workers, the ant carries its burden down into the
    nest hole. With its powerful jaws, another ant tugs
    the brittle remains of a once formidable foe—a jumping
    spider. So intent is the ant in its labor, it fails to
    avoid a deadly trap, however. In the soft ground
    along the margins of the trail is a craterfield of funnel-shaped
    pits. At the bottom of each, hidden just below
    the soil, waits quick death in the form of jaws even
    stronger than the ant’s. These insects, called antlions,
    are the larval stages of the equally voracious tiger-beetle.</p>
<p>Having tipped its load over the rim of the funnel,
    the ant disengages itself and attempts to crawl up the
    incline and get to the other side of the spider to pull
    it out again. But the loose soil particles offer little
    traction and the ant begins to slip. Frantic, it works
    its legs faster, making it slide downward more
    quickly. Alerted now by vibrations from the struggling
    insect, a hidden antlion waits its moment to
    strike. When the ant touches bottom, the hooked
    jaws appear, snapping once, twice, and finally closing
    shut about the thorax of its prey.</p>
<p>In a moment, all is over, the ant dragged beneath
    the soil at the bottom of the crater. The corpse of
    the spider, part way down the incline, is occasionally
    investigated by other passing ants. But the ants at
    the lip of the trap seem to sense the danger and leave
    the stranded prize alone. Other antlions, at the bottom
    of their expertly engineered traps, lie hidden from
    the passing parade of life above. Obeying their own
    instinct messages, they need only wait to survive.</p>
<p>A disturbance in the dog town starts the animals
    to barking and scurrying in every direction toward
    their burrows. Two figures from the campground
    have appeared up the incline. Their determined
    stride and the coils of rope at their shoulders suggest
    that the Tower’s summit may well be explored again
    today.</p>
<p>Already tall cumulus clouds, the beginnings of
    thunderheads, are building along the eastern horizon.
    A gust of hot air from the sun-baked ground
    below rushes into the pines, making the branches
    whizz into motion. A pine cone bounds against rock,
    setting the red squirrel to chattering again. I head
    for the Tower Trail, leaving behind the ant colony’s
    ordered turbulence and the view of the deserted dog
    town dancing in the sun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h4 id="ccc5">Eye of the Falcon</h4>
<p>At the juncture with the Red Beds Trail, I decide
    to follow the longer circuit of the Tower. The higher,
    shorter Tower Trail, which bracelets the rock-strewn
    base, can be picked up at the Visitor Center, where
    this trail ends. Folding the map, I hear the climbers
    approach.</p>
<p>“Good morning.”</p>
<p>The girl’s smile does not soften the concentrated
    expression all climbers wear before ascent.</p>
<p>“Which way are you going?” I ask, trying to conceal
    my lack of knowledge about any of the routes
    and knowing full well I would never venture what
    they are about to do.</p>
<p>“Left arm of the south face this time,” says the
    man. He obviously does not desire the delay of conversation
    but does volunteer that he had made several
    climbs the summer he worked here.</p>
<p>I hold them with another question: is there anything
    interesting on top?</p>
<p>“Terrific view. Grass on the summit; lots of chipmunks;
    once a rattlesnake was sighted. Well, we
    better get moving.”</p>
<p>“Good luck,” I call after them. The expression
    seems a lame wish for rock climbers. Soon they are
    brightly clad specks weaving through the trees. Looking
    up at the summit that towers above them, I wonder
    how a chipmunk or snake could have possibly
    gotten there—perhaps only by escaping the talons
    of an eagle or hawk. But could that happen?</p>
<p>More than 1,000 ascents of Devils Tower are now
    made each year. The almost casual manner in which
    experienced climbers regard the structure—often
    scaling it to keep in shape for “difficult” climbs—would
    have astounded early explorers, who regarded
    it as unscalable.</p>
<p>Shrill, rapid cries of a prairie falcon echo from the
    Tower wall. Although hidden from my view by the
    pines, its circling flight is revealed by its bursts of
    screams. It scolds the climbers who are now pressing
    upward and perhaps invading the security of its nest
    site. But the commotion soon dies away, indicating
    that the sharp-eyed falcon is more annoyed than
    threatened. Should the climbers inadvertently come
    close to the nest, however, the protective bird would
    repeatedly dive at the intruders in an attempt to drive
    them away, a distraction I would not relish.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>I continue down the trail, which gradually drops
    toward the river. The pines yield to communities of
    deciduous vegetation interspersed with grassy meadows.
    A whitetail deer stands at the far edge of the
    narrow meadow the trail is about to enter. Not yet
    aware of my presence, it continues to browse the
    succulent new growth of a chokecherry.</p>
<p>Were it not for the meadows and wooded ravines
    that surround the higher reaches of the pine forest,
    the Monument could not support as many deer as
    it does. Deer like a mix of woodland and meadow.
    The dense cover of shrub thickets, canopied by
    closely spaced elm, chokecherry, hawthorn, and other
    trees, offers sanctuary and browse. The nearby
    meadows provide essential diet supplements of grasses
    and herbs.</p>
<p>As I move on, the deer dashes away. A cottontail
    bounds across the trail and overhead, on a long,
    twisted branch of a burr oak, a fox squirrel scurries
    upward to safety. A brown thrasher scolds momentarily
    but soon resumes its complex song. Its music
    is as various in shading and structure as the many
    leaf shapes that can be discovered in its habitat.</p>
<p>Before abruptly reversing itself, the trail makes a
    long swing northward. Leaving the pines, it crosses
    the maroon sediments that give the Red Beds Trail
    its name. The exposed formation has been cut into
    steep cliffs by the river. Deposited some 180 million
    years ago during the Jurassic Period, when the land
    surface was low and adjacent to a sea, this mixture
    of siltstone and sandstone is poorly cemented together.
    As a result, it weathers easily, forming a
    striking, ravine-cut outcrop wherever the stratum is
    exposed. Few plants colonize this handsome formation,
    making it stand out against the dull, igneous-gray
    Tower and its dark wreath of ponderosa.</p>
<p>As the sun approaches zenith, I am nearing the
    end of the trail circuit. Coming back closer to the
    Tower, the trail re-enters the pine forest. I welcome
    the perceptibly cooler air and dimmer surroundings
    beneath these big, yellow-barked trees. Here, where
    lichen and moss cap boulders and fallen logs, is a
    good spot for lunch. I sit with my back to the trunk
    of an ancient, fallen giant whose length has collapsed
    and defines the contours of the ground. Its exposed,
    rotten heartwood nourishes miniature fungi-gardens.</p>
<p>Compared to the sharp shadows and glare of the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
    meadows and thickets I have left behind, the evenly
    shaded pine forest seems serene. Except for a diminutive
    red-breasted nuthatch that patrols up and
    down a nearby tree trunk, gleaning grubs and other
    insects as it goes, there is no perceptible motion.
    Even the few shafts of sunlight that touch the forest
    floor here seem, like me, to be intruders. Sound itself
    seems unwelcome. No birds sing or squabble or dart
    their colors to catch the eye. If anything walks or
    hops about, no leaves rustle to reveal its presence.
    Years of needle-cast shroud the uneven ground, giving
    the dissimilar shapes of rock and downed trees
    a sameness of color and texture.</p>
<p>Comparatively few life-forms inhabit the pine forest.
    Fewer kinds of plants grow beneath the pines
    than grow in the deciduous woodland. And fewer
    plant types mean a more limited diet for herbivores
    such as insects, mice, cottontails, and deer. The
    scarcity of insects also reduces the number of bird
    species that will find the habitat attractive.</p>
<p>The relative absence of life on the forest floor
    begins in the soil. Pines create acid soil conditions
    which do not promote bacterial growth. Decay,
    therefore, carried on primarily by fungi, takes place
    very slowly. The result is the thick accumulation of
    discarded needles and branches, the resinous, sweet-smelling
    “duff.”</p>
<p>Not far upslope from the trail a porcupine scuttles
    toward a stand of young pines. It moves slowly and
    silently, its quills making it look prehistoric. Again
    I am struck by the apparent changelessness of the
    pine forest.</p>
<p>But looking around, I find everywhere signs that
    indicate change and struggle. At the bases of the
    giant pines—some of which may be more than 200
    years old—are fire scars. Most of the mature trees
    survived the frequent fires that once raced through
    here. Their bark was thick and fire-resistant, and
    they had few lower branches to pass the flames up
    into the vulnerable upper branches. But that was
    before the white man interrupted the long reign of
    wildfire. Ironically, fire had actually helped to maintain
    the health of the forest. Grass fires, sweeping
    into the pines, burned off the accumulations of litter
    and killed many of the crowded younger trees. Tinder
    was thus removed before it could build to dangerous
    levels.</p>

        <p>Some animals indigenous to the Great Plains find a protected
            home in Devils Tower National Monument. Gone
            from this area are the bison that once roamed the prairie
            grasslands in great numbers, and the fastest plains animal,
            the pronghorn antelope, is rare. The most noticeable

            (See pages <a class="pgref pginternal" href="#Page_48">48</a>-65 for pictures and text about the prairie dog
            and its predators), but with careful observation you can

<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>Now, after 80 years of fire-prevention management,
    the forest is ripe for fire. Should it come now,
    however, the effects might be devastating. Fed by
    an abundance of ground fuel, a cool-burning, fast-moving
    grass fire could quickly become “hot.” Lifted
    up into the upper branches of the old pines via the
    closely spaced younger trees, the ground fire would
    quickly develop into a crown fire. Few, if any, trees
    would survive such a conflagration.</p>
<p>The role of natural fire has only recently been
    appreciated. However, in the small area of Devils
    Tower, where the scenic qualities of the pine forest
    are paramount to visitor enjoyment of the Monument,
    fire cannot be permitted without virtual destruction
    of the surrounding forest. Thus, for esthetic
    reasons, fire is regarded as unacceptable here.</p>
<p>After lunch I walk on beneath the trees. The
    openness of the mature pine forest soon gives way
    to dense groves of younger ponderosa. Deprived of
    the separation they require to develop naturally,
    these “doghair” stands strain upward together
    their trunks toothpick thin—to reach the light. Many
    exhibit long, yellow wounds, from which sap bleeds.
    This is the work of porcupines. Gnawing through the
    thin bark of young trees with sharp, chisel-shaped
    teeth, they strip away the tender, living tissue of the
    tree. Most wounds are not severe, but should the
    trunk be girdled, the moisture and nutrient transport
    system of the tree will be severed and the pine will
    die. Thus, even though fire no longer occurs here
    regularly, other agents of control, such as porcupine
    damage and insect infestation, continue to work.</p>
<p>The trail emerges from the deep north-slope forest,
    runs parallel to the visitor center access road for
    a short distance, and ends at the parking lot. The
    glare of afternoon light and shimmering heat waves
    is a sharp contrast to the cool, dim surroundings of
    the deeper forest.</p>
<p>Before continuing on around the circuit of Tower
    Trail, I stop at the visitor center for water. Beside
    the fountain sits an old man, leaning his chin and
    hands on a cane and staring upward at the broad
    west face of the Tower. An immense mushroom of
    a towering cumulus cloud billows up behind it.</p>
<p>“Quite a sight,” I say.</p>
<p>He seems to deliberate, then finally answers: “I
    can remember seeing a picture of this in my school
    <span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
    book. I never thought I would live to see it. Never
    thought I would ever sit here like this and see it
    genuine.”</p>
<p>I don’t know what to say. One does not make idle
    conversation with a man who has made a pilgrimage.
    We watch a pair of rock doves, outlined against the
    white brilliance of the boiling cloud, ride an updraft
    near the summit. Wings set and almost touching,
    they dip and recover, their resonant calls clear despite
    the distance. Nothing more to be said, I set out
    toward the trail. Not once did the man take his eyes
    off the Tower.</p>
<p>With the first dull report of thunder, I hear the
    chiding call of the falcon again. Its sharp voice momentarily
    silences the mellow cooings of rock doves
    that filter down from the high crannies and ledges.</p>
<p>The trail steeply ascends a slope of broken, fallen
    columns, weaving among the immense rock slabs like
    a mouse-run in a boulder field. I am surprised to see
    a grove of aspens. Their crooked trunks bend in the
    freshening wind, their leaves dancing and blinking
    on and off the dusty silver of their undersides. What
    a contrast to the rigid stature of the surrounding
    pines that barely acknowledge the approaching
    storm.</p>
<p>The presence of aspen probably means that a fire
    once swept across this dry western shoulder. Quick
    to invade new territory after a fire, aspens play an
    important role as a pioneer species of the western
    and northern American coniferous forests. Like the
    ponderosa, they can grow on dry, rocky sites. Since
    they often reproduce vegetatively—a grove of aspens
    is often produced by sprouting from the roots of a
    single tree—aspens are well suited to unstable or fire-swept
    sites. Although readily consumed by fire, aspen
    groves regenerate quickly from their undamaged
    root systems. Without periodic fire, in fact, aspens
    are eventually excluded from the forest composition,
    shaded out by the taller growing conifers.</p>
<p>The growing turbulence spurs me onward. Hugging
    the steep upper slopes of the Tower’s circular
    base, the trail allows a speedy orbit. The falcon continues
    to scream. Now along the southeastern face,
    I can hear the climbers shout to one another. The
    belly of the cloud is overhead and angry-black. Lightning
    flashes are now immediately followed by loud
    reports, sharp as splitting wood. I should turn back
    <span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
    and drop to the nearby trail that returns to the campground,
    but the swell of wind in the pines and the
    occasional crash of falling snags is invigorating. A
    sudden invasion of cold air means the rain will come
    heavy and soon. I wonder if the climbers are as unprepared
    for this as I am.</p>
<p>In a rock crevice where the trail passes along a
    cliff face, an untidy ring of trash reveals the nest site
    of a wood rat. Called “pack rats” because of their
    habit of carrying off unguarded items, these big rodents
    adorn their nest entrances with anything from
    bottle caps to sunglasses. This one has amassed a
    fine collection of discarded gum and candy wrappers.
    As the first large raindrops thud down into the trail’s
    soft earth, I envy the animal’s protective retreat.</p>
<p>In ten minutes I am back at the spur that leads to
    the Visitor Center. If the old man is still there, perhaps
    I will wait out the storm with him beneath the
    porch roof. But I cannot see him, so I continue on
    to the campground. I am already soaked through
    anyway, so the lashing rain is no longer a threat. I
    retrace the section of trail I had walked an hour
    before. Ten minutes more and I leave the pines and
    enter the deserted, puddled prairie dog town.</p>
<p>Nearing the road, I see a car approaching slowly.
    As it passes I notice the old man. Leaning forward,
    he cranes his neck to catch a last glimpse of the
    Tower he had waited so long to see.</p>
<h4 id="ccc6">Voice of the Kingfisher</h4>
<p>By late afternoon the storm has passed, and with the
    return of sunlight a rainbow arches the Belle Fourche.
    Taking advantage of the softened earth, the prairie
    dogs busily reshape their mounds, scratching dirt
    loose, bulldozing it up the slopes of entrance mounds,
    and tamping it. All but the young wear black
    noses. At the return of the climbers the town suspends
    its work, rises to alert, and chirps warning.</p>
<p>A meadowlark sings from a fence post near the
    river. Against the purple southern sky, its black and
    yellow vestments seem unnaturally bright, and its
    call in the rain-cleared air seems sharply amplified.
    It glides into the glistening grass. Soon the female,
    wearing a duller version of its mate’s tuxedo, flies
    up and disappears across the narrow river. When she
    returns, her bill is crammed with insects for her demanding
    <span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
    young in their grass-lined ground nest.</p>
<p>A red-headed woodpecker, which has been shuttling
    between a certain cottonwood and other trees,
    also reveals its nest site. High up in the tree it has
    excavated a perfectly round hole. Leaning back on
    stiff tail feathers, it jerkily climbs up and around the
    trunk, pauses at the hole, then leans in to deliver the
    white grub to its squealing young.</p>
<p>So insatiable are nestling birds, their demands exert
    a significant control on insect populations. A pair
    of adult house wrens may log more than 1,100 daily
    trips to feed their young.</p>
<p>That so many varieties of birds can co-exist in the
    same area is possible because different species generally
    do not compete with one another for the same
    food source. Each gleans its food in a slightly different
    manner and locale. Each species vigorously
    defends its territory from others of its kind but will
    tolerate neighbors that occupy a different niche in
    the community. A single plum thicket may contain
    the nests of a pair of catbirds, mourning doves, robins,
    and vireos. Because each bird hunts its food in
    a slightly different manner and place, they do not
    directly compete.</p>
<p>The cliff-nesting swifts and swallows have reappeared
    above the river, a twittering confusion of
    swirling, darting shapes that manage to survive by
    capturing insects on the wing. Higher up, the booming
    of nighthawks announces that insects are active
    in the upper air also.</p>
<p>After supper I walk along the river. Now that shadows
    fill the river bed, there might be an opportunity
    to see a beaver working or a mink hunting along the
    shore. Passing close to where the meadowlarks have
    their nest, I cause a panic of concern. Both birds,
    invisible a second ago, lift off the ground, scolding
    and threatening, to distract my attention from the
    location of the nest. The outcry brings a killdeer up
    from the shore of the river. Uttering its plaintive,
    reedy cry, it circles about, lands, runs rapidly along
    the bank, then crouches down to display a “broken”
    wing. It is joined by a mate and both birds take up
    the act, leading me away from their own eggs or
    helpless young hiding motionless on the ground. So
    adept are the killdeer at this diversion, it seems incredible
    that instinct and not intelligence is responsible
    for their highly specialized behavior.</p>

        <p>Though small in area, Devils
            Tower National Monument
            provides a sanctuary for an
            extensive variety of birds. Because
            the mountains and the
            plains converge here, species
            common to both can be
            found. More than 90 species
            have been counted.</p>
        <p>Several large birds may be
            seen flying around or near the
            Tower itself, occasionally
            swooping down to prey upon
            life in the open grasslands.
            These include Cooper’s and
            red-tailed hawks; American
            kestrel; golden and bald eagles;
            prairie falcon, and turkey

<p>The meadow across the river is a solid yellow of
    blooming spurge. In contrast, the ground on the
    Monument side of the river presents only a few isolated
    plants, and they are limp and pale from the
    effects of herbicide. Because spurge is an exotic plant
    that invades grasslands and displaces native flora, it
    is exterminated, through selective application of herbicide,
    within the Monument boundaries.</p>
<p>The rattle of a kingfisher precedes its sudden appearance
    around the sharp bend in the river. Skimming
    low across the water, the blue and white bird
    darts upward to perch on a cottonwood snag that
    overhangs the river. Its large crest and straight bill
    make the kingfisher look more caricature than real.
    Intently studying the river below, it need not wait
    long before plummeting from its observation post
    straight into the water. Reappearing a second later,
    it quickly regains its perch, the silver glint of a small
    fish caught in the parted scissors of its black bill.
    After swallowing the fish with a toss of its head, it
    shakes the water from its feathers and resumes its
    patient inspection.</p>
<p>Like a giant, soundless mosquito, a cranefly rises
    upward from the river bank. Another hovers low
    across the surface of the water, frequently dipping
    its abdomen below the surface to deposit its eggs.
    The first quickly disappears with the banking flight
    of a nighthawk; the second with the darting intercept
    of a dragonfly. Like countless other species of insects
    that divide their lives between the water and land,
    the craneflies are a living link in the food chain that
    helps bind the aquatic and terrestrial life communities
    together.</p>
<p>The many thousands of insect species requiring an
    underwater environment for their larval stage help
    sustain many species of terrestrial predators when
    the insects emerge from the water as adults. The
    kingfisher that nests here and the occasional great
    blue heron that stops during migration also enjoy the
    fruits of the water community, taking fish and frogs.
    But the process is not a one-way street. Nutrients
    leached from the land help fertilize the aquatic food
    chain. And the grasshopper that inadvertently hops
    into the river, only to disappear quickly into the gullet
    of a fish, represents another of the ongoing exchanges
    between land and water.</p>
<p>As I round the sharp bend that sends the river
    <span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
    flowing north again, a muskrat hurries into the water
    and submerges. On the steep bank high above the
    river, I wait until it surfaces in midstream. It floats
    lazily for a while, its long, naked tail straight with
    the slow current. Then it heads back toward shore.
    Across the river, the floodplain cottonwoods bear
    the scars of beaver teeth. Some are girdled and dead.
    Others are in full leaf despite deep but incomplete
    incisions.</p>
<p>Growing dusk fills the river valley. In the failing
    sunlight vanquished to a thin, vertical display on the
    Tower face, it is almost possible to imagine what this
    splendid landscape must have been like as wilderness.
    Bison, not cattle, would have grazed nearby.
    Instead of the howling dog that has escaped the
    campground and races into the prairie dog town, a
    wolf might be pressing home its attack on an injured
    pronghorn. Grizzlies and cougars knew this valley,
    and the river was tamed not by a nearby reservoir
    but by a latticework of beaver dams.</p>
<p>There are no prairie dogs left above ground now
    to challenge my trespass as I head back toward the
    welcome firelights of the campground. The deer have
    left their daybeds to graze in the open, and the great
    horned owl again asserts its dominance in the river
    timber. With a long rattle, briefly echoed from a
    cliff, the kingfisher quits the day.</p>
<p>Beneath the expanding population of stars, I return
    to the comfort of hot coffee and the confines
    of my own world. For now, I am content with the
    memory of eagle and falcon. In my mind they will
    continue to soar, inspecting the splendid terrain my
    memory today acquired.</p>

<p>When the long grip of winter’s crusted snow relaxes,
    pasqueflowers burst forth in ravines, unplowed pastures,
    and abandoned cemeteries. Their delicate silvery
    purple contrasts with the bleak stubble of last
    year’s ruined grasses. Before plows ever broke the
    grassland sod, pasqueflowers were so profuse the
    distant ground seemed veiled in haze. The pioneers
    called it “prairie smoke.”</p>
<p>With the appearance of the pasqueflowers, spring
    begins to renew the sun-warmed ground. Gone are
    the long days of waiting. Perhaps, the few prairie-dog
    sentinels that had stood motionless in the March
    wind wished that the spring would come. The sharp
    wind divides the dense fur of their winter coats while
    they survey the snow-skiffed ground of their silent
    town. They almost appear to regard the sun wistfully,
    wishing it strong, the snow gone, and the grass resurgent
    once again. But at last the meadowlarks lose
    their winter-long quiet, and the horned larks now lift
    up with extravagance, unhuddling from their long
    ordeal. Below ground, in the deep, secure warmth
    of their nursery chambers, a new generation of prairie
    dogs is developing, part of the ancient ritual of
    replenishment that spring brings to the Great Plains.</p>
<p>The breeding season of the prairie dog is determined
    by geographic location and weather conditions.
    On the southern plains of Texas it may be as
    early as January; on the Canadian plains as late as
    March. For four or five weeks there is much kissing,
    grooming, and investigation. Males become aggressive
    and squabble over territory. Besides the older
    females, perhaps half of the yearling females will
    mate.</p>
<p>After a month’s gestation, the litters are born. In
    the dark quiet of specially prepared nesting chambers,
    the babies appear, hairless, sightless, uncoordinated,
    weighing but 14 grams (0.5 ounce). They live
    in grass-lined nests for seven or eight weeks, attended
    almost constantly by the females as they develop.
    Growth is rapid. At 28 days they are crawling,
    and by 32 days the finely furred pups can walk and
    bark. Soon their eyes open and they fully resemble
    the adults. Until now the pups have known only darkness,
    blind passageways, and a single adult. One day
    soon they will be led upward.</p>
<p>That first moment above ground marks for them
    another birth. Now their senses experience a sudden
    <span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
    flood of light and sound, coolness, wind, a world of
    shape, motion, and perspective, whose staggering
    brightness extends forever beyond their own rim of
    familiar scent. Huddled together and shivering in the
    wind, they are at first loath to accept this world of
    sight and sun, so different from the soundless wrappings
    of dark, warm soil. But soon, as with all young
    animals, curiosity leads them to investigation and
    then to boldness.</p>

</div>
<p>Each day the young spend more time above
    ground. Nearby, the mother remains alert for danger
    and solicitous, accepting the maulings of her playful
    and increasingly independent pups. Although ranging
    farther and farther afield, they remain obedient
    to their mother, and scamper back to their burrow
    when commanded. The first few weeks above ground
    is a time of weaning, learning, and conditioning.</p>
<p>During their first few days in society, pups have
    the run of the town. Boundaries that adults respect
    do not exist for them, as they wander about, inspecting
    every feature of their new world. The young
    have an insatiable need for body contact and much
    time is spent at play, and in grooming and kissing,
    activities that seem to reinforce the social nature of
    the prairie dogs. Adult males tolerate the young for
    a time during this period of general acquaintance.
    At first the pups attempt to nurse from any adult
    they encounter, and these misguided attempts are
    not rebuked, even by the males; they are turned into
    grooming sessions.</p>
<p>Life on this greening land seems too good to be
    true. Entertainment is everywhere. Grasshopper
    nymphs, which the adult prairie dogs occasionally
    capture and consume unceremoniously, provide
    them with hours of chase and stalk. Food is everywhere
    and easy to obtain. Imitating their elders, the
    pups sample the wide array of grasses and forbs surrounding
    every burrow.</p>
<p>Like the young of all the other animals they see,
    the pups have no way of realizing that their debut
    coincides with the season most favorable to their
    survival. So they scamper about in witless abandon,
    uncautious and innocent, ignorant as yet of the
    harsher outlines of their world. For a time, their
    place in the community is as idyllic as the soft-winded
    afternoons of spring. But on the Great Plains, spring
    is at best an uncertain season, its lifespan often
    <span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
    breathtakingly short. As the days pass, the dominant
    males that patrol their territories rapidly lose patience
    with neighboring pups. Those that stray outside
    the invisible boundaries of their clan’s living-space
    are now met with annoyance. Soon the displeasure
    turns to snarls and bites. More and more,
    their own mothers refuse them milk. Nipples bleeding
    from the constant pesterings of their young, the
    mothers finally move out altogether, to establish new
    burrows of their own.</p>
<p>To survive predatory perils, the new generation
    of prairie dogs, like countless previous ones, must
    master a two-pronged defense system evolved over
    millions of years. First, the pups must learn to engineer
    a burrow system with alternate escape routes.
    Second, they must learn to live in a highly organized
    social order, heeding its signals and respecting its
    boundaries.</p>
<p>Prairie dogs are divided into two general classes,
    the blacktailed and the whitetailed. Blacktails inhabit
    the semi-arid regions of the Great Plains; whitetails
    live in the higher elevations of mountain parks and
    foothills. But it’s difficult to generalize, for Devils
    Tower and Wind Cave National Park, in South Dakota,
    are in the Black Hills and the prairie dogs at
    both are blacktails. The dog town at Devils Tower
    occupies a level grassland bench between the Tower’s
    base and the nearby meandering Belle Fourche
    River. Blacktails are protected in their more typical
    arid topography at two other National Park System
    areas: Badlands National Park in South Dakota and
    Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota.</p>
<p>Generally, as a result of dissimilar habitats, the
    two species exhibit slightly different patterns of behavior.
    Unlike the blacktails, which emerge to forage
    on sunny winter days, whitetails are confined to their
    burrows by deep mountain snows. Those at high elevations
    must hibernate to survive the long winter.</p>
<p>The whitetail community is a much less highly developed
    social structure than the blacktail community.
    The animals are unable to enjoy the luxury of
    long summers. In the short season they must spend
    a great amount of time feeding to store up body fat
    for winter. They have little time for social rituals—grooming,
    greeting, or play. Time does not allow
    them to establish and maintain territories.</p>
<p>The burrow is to the prairie dog what speed and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
    endurance is to the pronghorn: its chief means of
    protection. Yet it is more than just a hole in the
    ground, a temporary refuge from the threat of danger.
    More than half of a prairie dog’s life is spent
    below ground, so the burrow must accommodate a
    wide range of needs (See pages <a class="pgref pginternal" href="#Page_56">56</a>-57.).</p>
<p>Often old burrow systems are abandoned and new
    tunnels excavated. The debris from the new tunnel
    system is dumped into the old burrows. These
    plugged burrows, called cores, may, in time, be more
    extensive than active tunnels in a long-occupied
    town. Whether knowingly or unknowingly, the prairie
    dog, by plugging unused passages, is practicing
    sound engineering; if all excavated material were
    brought to the surface, the weakened sub-surface,
    riddled with tunnels, would begin to settle and the
    burrows would eventually collapse.</p>
<p>As with the beaver—the only North American
    mammal whose engineering feats surpass the prairie
    dog’s—it is often difficult to distinguish instinctive
    behavior from actual problem solving. Burrow systems
    vary from individual to individual and with local
    topography. However, as early attempts to “drown
    out” prairie dogs soon proved, the overall design of
    their burrow networks minimizes the dangers of
    flooding. While the lower angle of the tunnel may
    fill with water, the portion of the burrow that culminates
    in the sealed escape hole serves as an air
    bell, preventing a further rise of water and protecting
    the animal from being flooded out of its sanctuary
    during periods of heavy rain. Not realizing that prairie
    dogs can live without water—as can many other
    plains mammals that manufacture metabolic water
    from foods they eat—instigators of attempts to
    drown out the animals concluded that the animals
    dug down to ground water. The myth of the “town
    well” persisted until well diggers discovered that the
    water table in most townsites was hundreds of meters
    down.</p>
<p>More than once their burrows have saved them
    from talon and teeth, and they take care to maintain
    the mounds surrounding the entrances to their tunnels.
    These structures serve not only as watch-towers,
    but also as dikes against downpours that may
    temporarily turn a town into a lake.</p>
<p>But even instinctive digging habits and well engineered
    burrows, by themselves, would not have permitted
    prairie dogs to achieve their once staggering
    population levels—estimated to have been about
    25 <i>billion</i> individuals. Only through the additional
    benefits of some form of social organization and an
    effective means of communication could such success
    have been attained.</p>

            <p class="pcap">A prairie dog sounds the alarm, alerting the whole
                town about an impending danger, such as a coyote, a
                ferret, or a person. The rest take up the call, and as the
                danger approaches each burrow the inhabitants duck underground.
                The others continue to stand erect and sound
                the warning. By listening carefully, those underground
                can track the location of the enemy. When two high-pitched
                notes are sounded, all rush for cover, for that means
                a hawk is overhead or nearby and there’s no time to wait
                and repeat the signal. After the danger has disappeared, a
                dog sounds a melodic whistle, and a few others repeat the
                all-clear before the usual activities of grooming, breeding,
                eating, and burrow building are resumed. Blacktails make
                at least seven other calls, but they mostly concern matters
                of interest to the coterie, or family, instead of to the whole town.</p>

            <p class="pcap">After spending a little more than a month below ground,
                newborn pups warily venture into the daylight, closely
                watched by their mother. They soon lose their timidness,
                venturing farther and farther from the burrow but
                remaining obedient to mother’s commands. Most of
                the first few weeks on the surface are spent mauling,
                kissing, or grooming each other and their parents. As
                the weeks go by, the adults tolerate less play and the pups
                learn more and more day-to-day survival responsibilities.</p>

            <p class="pcap">A prairie dog eats a blade of grass sitting on its haunches.
                After falling over a few times, pups soon learn this dining
                posture. The dogs eat various grasses and forbs, though for
                different periods they tend to ignore some plants in favor of
                others. However, they usually clip off all vegetation around
                their burrows even if they don’t eat it. This habitual
                grass-cutting apparently is defensive, for predators can
                conceal themselves better in tall grasses. That is why you
                don’t see prairie dogs in lush grasslands where there is a
                bountiful rainfall. They satisfy most of their needs for water
                with the juices of green plants and grass roots.</p>
            <p class="pcapc">Prairie dogs also eat insects that inhabit their towns and
                sometimes prey upon the eggs or young of animals, such as
                the burrowing owl, that dwell in homes deserted by prairie dogs.</p>

            <p class="pcap">Viewed in a cross-section, a typical prairie dog burrow
                system reveals a network of tunnels and compartments.
                The slightly oval entrance, 10 to 15 centimeters (4 to 6
                inches) in diameter, leads the prairie dog rapidly downward.
                This plunge hole soon tapers off into a more gentle slope
                that may descend another 4.5 meters (15 feet). The burrow
                then turns upward and approaches the surface about 9
                meters (30 feet) from the entrance hole. In an emergency
                this safety hatch can be quickly opened and the prairie
                dog can escape entrapment. Every burrow contains several
                rooms to accommodate various needs. The first room the
                prairie dog encounters as it travels down the plunge hole
                is known as the antechamber. which is large enough for two
                animals. It functions as a turn-around, permitting entering
                and exiting animals to pass one another. But primarily
                it is used as a listening post. Before venturing out in
                the morning, a prairie dog pauses here, on the alert for
                possible danger. From this room it can monitor the situation
                by listening to alarm calls of neighbors still above ground.
                The nesting chamber may be found most anywhere in the
                burrow, but usually it is associated with the main passageway
                above the lowest point, to protect it from flooding.
                Lined with grasses and other soft plant fibers, the nest affords
                a degree of comfort and insulation against cold and
                dampness. Perhaps because of accumulating litter or parasites,
                such as lice and fleas, the location of the nest chamber is often changed.</p>

<p>Gregariousness is a common trait of many plains
    animals. In a land where movement is necessary and
    concealment difficult to achieve, it provides a definite
    survival advantage. Bison calves find protection
    in the herd, where their defense is the concern of all
    adults. Pronghorns take turns as sentries, allowing
    the other members of the group to rest and feed.
    Coyotes are more effective when hunting in pairs.
    The success of the wolf in bringing down large prey
    and even evicting grizzlies from their kills was largely
    due to their family group or pack organization. But
    lacking physical adaptations for speed and mobility,
    prairie dogs are forced to rely on their burrows for
    refuge. The need to remain close to their burrows
    imposes on the animals a serious problem: how to
    maintain an adequate food supply?</p>
<p>Although a dog town might appear to be one big
    collection of affectionate family members, all coming
    and going at will, the impression is false. Instead,
    each town is divided up into small groups of related
    animals. These family groups, called coteries, are the
    basic social unit, much as human families are in our
    own society. As the prairie dog pups soon learn, each
    coterie defends its own territory from intrusion by
    others, thus preserving for itself necessary living
    space and an adequate food supply close to the safety
    of its own burrows. Only in times of dire emergency,
    when the scramble to safety supersedes all territorial
    claims, will prairie dogs allow other coterie members
    the use of their burrows. So strong is an offending
    animal’s sense of trespass, it will often brave the
    hazard of dashing back to its own burrow rather than
    staying long in a neighbor’s territory.</p>
<p>The typical coterie consists of about seven to eight
    animals, arranged in a hierarchical order. Each usually
    has a dominant male that protects the coterie’s
    territory from invasion by other males and oversees
    the activities of the females and young. If the coterie
    is a large one, more than one individual may enjoy
    dominant status and share the duties of leadership.
    In some cases, females may be dominant in rank;
    <span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
    the role generally falls to the males, however, possibly
    because of their slightly larger size or because
    they have more time to observe and patrol, not being
    tied to the demands of the young.</p>
<p>Not only their social organization, but also their
    social behavior makes prairie dogs unique among
    rodents. The function of coterie hierarchy is cooperative,
    rather than oppressive, resulting in a remarkable
    absence of conflict and social stress. Aggressiveness
    is generally limited to inter-coterie
    contacts along the invisible boundaries. In an established
    town, infractions are usually accidental and
    seldom precipitate lasting disputes. The end result
    of intra-coterie cooperation and inter-coterie respect
    is a stable and harmonious town. Energies and attention
    that would otherwise be squandered in conflict
    can thus be focused on mutual defense.</p>
<p>For brief periods during spring and fall, the strict
    laws of territoriality are relaxed. In spring, the period
    coincides with the appearance of pups. Not only does
    this prevent undue strife in the community over the
    wanderings of the socially ignorant pups; it also allows
    those females seeking new territories to cross
    established ones. In the fall, the period is also necessary,
    accommodating the dispersal of overcrowded
    family groups. During autumn, the urge to emigrate
    is strong, and many animals move out into the “suburbs”
    of the town. Thus the town maintains a degree
    of flexibility and avoids permanent pockets of
    overpopulation.</p>
<p>Coterie members maintain mutual recognition
    through an often-repeated ritual involving mouth
    contact. Prairie dogs that appear to be “kissing” or
    “talking” are simply establishing identities. Generally
    the most dominant member will initiate mouth
    contact, approaching the second animal with head
    tilted back and presenting its open mouth, to which
    the other responds in like manner. Often the recognition
    ceremony is accompanied by tail wagging
    and frequently leads to another form of social reinforcement,
    the process of grooming. Generally, the
    prairie dog that initiates the mouth contact does the
    grooming, nibbling, and combing the fur in an effort
    to dislodge dirt and parasites. The act is more significant
    for its symbolic value, however, for the animal
    of lower rank will often completely roll over on
    its back during the process; by exposing its vulnerable
    undersides, it is submitting, canine fashion, to
    the dominance of its fellow. Pups that annoy adult
    males with their attentions are often rather roughly
    groomed. No doubt the procedure communicates
    authority as well as affection.</p>

        <p>Many pups and some adults are lost to predators. While
            small, prairie dogs are fair game for rattlesnakes and
            burrowing owls. Hawks, like the eagles, ambush pups from
            the sky. Patrolling coyotes are quick to sense the pups’ hesitation
            and to capitalize on the uncertainty. Badgers excavate
            with astounding speed; bobcats rush from concealment of
            any nearby cover. And in some places the most dreaded
            predator of all is the black-footed ferret, which enters the
            burrow itself to surprise and trap its prey. But eradication
            programs against the prairie dog have made the ferret
            nearly extinct; none has been seen at Devils Tower since the
            late 1800s. Some of the other predators of the prairie dog
            also have been nearly eliminated by man. And with the
            loss of natural predators, prairie dog populations flourish
            rapidly. Unless these predators are allowed to make a comeback,
            prairie dog control programs will be inevitable.</p>

<p>Should the individual invited to mouth contact not
    reciprocate, an immediate challenge is made. Apparently,
    mouth contact is the only positive means
    of identification available to prairie dogs, and any
    animal refusing it is immediately deemed a trespasser
    and aggressively evicted. The wild chase that ensues,
    accompanied by indignant calling and fierce chattering
    of teeth, sometimes leads the righteous landowner
    deep inside its neighbor’s territory. The roles
    abruptly reverse and, after a moment of mutual realization,
    the pursuer suddenly becomes the pursued.</p>
<p>In the glare of the early evening sun it is difficult
    to distinguish the individual prairie dogs as they go
    about their various activities. A single warning call,
    however, and the town instantly sprouts battalions
    of erect postures. For a moment, each motionless,
    backlit figure shines its sun-haloed position. All the
    disparate activities of the scattered animals become
    instantaneously fused to a single purpose: identifying
    the danger.</p>
<p>Vocalizations distinguish the prairie dog from all
    other rodents. At least ten different calls have been
    identified in the blacktail class of prairie dogs. Most
    of the calls—such as the challenge bark, defense
    bark, disputing “<i>churr</i>,” fighting snarl, fear scream,
    muffled bark, and tooth chattering—do not involve
    the entire community. Except for the fear scream,
    which is immediately noted by all members, these
    vocal signals are largely ignored by neighboring animals
    since they usually denote a local disturbance
    among the prairie dogs themselves. There are three
    warning calls, however, that are intended for the
    entire community; these constitute the bond that
    unites all the separate coteries of the town into a
    single social unit.</p>
<p>At the sound of the <i>warning bark</i>, usually uttered
    by many animals at once and quickly relayed through
    the entire town, each prairie dog immediately rises
    to alert in an attempt to define the immediate danger.
    If the wave of alarms is particularly intense, the animals
    usually rush to burrow mounds, where they
    will await further developments. Usually only the
    <span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
    prairie dogs in the immediate vicinity of an enemy
    will retire below ground. The remainder of the population
    continues to observe and sound the alarm.
    As an enemy approaches a particular burrow, the
    frequency and intensity of the occupant’s warning
    bark increases. Only at the last moment will the prairie
    dog cut short its tirade, capping it with an indignant
    <i>churk</i> as it dives below ground.</p>
<p>Another, more urgent, signal is the <i>hawk warning
    call</i>. The high-pitched, musical twin notes of this cry
    prompt an immediate dash for cover. Unlike the typical
    reaction to the warning bark, response to the
    hawk warning call is unhesitating. When this cry is
    given, seconds count, and visual confirmation of danger
    is not required to prompt a rush to safety.</p>
<p>After danger has passed, the all-clear is sounded.
    Known as the <i>song bark</i>, this melodic whistle is always
    associated with a particular body posture. Rising
    up on its haunches, the prairie dog points its nose
    to the sky, gives the whistle, and promptly falls back
    on all fours. When learning to execute this call, pups
    usually topple over backwards. Once uttered, the
    call is repeated sporadically throughout the town.</p>
<p>Communication is as important to the survival of
    the prairie dog society as is adequate food and shelter.
    Towns decimated by disease or poisoning soon
    vanish if the survivors are too few or scattered to
    communicate effectively. Deprived of an efficient
    warning system (and perhaps of the psychological
    need of social contact, as well), individual animals
    make easy targets for predators. Certainly they are
    too large and conspicuous to blend in well with their
    sparse surroundings. Unlike their small, well-camouflaged
    cousins, the thirteen-lined ground squirrels,
    prairie dogs cannot survive as individuals.</p>
<p>After the females leave their weaned pups to establish
    new burrows for themselves, the young will
    remain together for a while until they, too, begin to
    split up. No longer do they resemble the playful,
    romping pups of spring, annoying their elders with
    their ceaseless games, demands for attention, and
    disregard for territorial boundaries. Now full-fledged
    members of their clans, they capture grasshoppers
    in a business-like fashion. Like the season, they have
    matured. With the company of their elders they now
    share a suspicion of the sky and every uninspected
    plot of ground.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h4 id="ccc7">Lessons a Long Time Learning</h4>
<p>In the early days of the cattle range, before sound
    land management of the plains was understood, cattlemen
    were perplexed to witness mushrooming populations
    of prairie dogs. Formerly lush grassland
    often became a dog town “wasteland” following the
    introduction of cattle. Believing that the prairie dog,
    and not the cattle, was responsible for this sudden
    transformation, ranchers rapidly came to despise
    prairie dogs. A massive war of extermination began
    against these “varmits” that “ate the grass down to
    nothing.” In reality, the appearance of prairie dogs
    merely indicated that the land was being overgrazed.
    As the bison had done before them, cattle now began
    to open up to the prairie dogs new territories that
    they could not otherwise colonize. Prairie dogs were
    never found on the eastern prairies simply because
    they could not contend with the taller growth of the
    more humid grasslands.</p>
<p>On their own, prairie dogs cannot easily invade
    unbroken areas of established grassland. The grass
    cover simply rejuvenates faster than the animals can
    work. But if the land has been disturbed by overgrazing,
    prairie dogs can quickly spread. Once established
    in an area, the animals wage a constant
    struggle against the vegetation. Since tall-growing
    plants offer concealment to a predator, the plants
    are routinely clipped off even if they are not to be
    eaten.</p>
<p>The feeding, clearing, and burrowing activities of
    the dog town tend to retard the grasses while encouraging
    the persistence of forbs—the broadleaf
    plants that quickly invade disturbed ground but are
    eventually crowded out by the returning grasses. By
    arresting the normal process of plant succession, an
    active dog town delays the return of the site to its
    climax vegetation of grasses. In so doing, it inadvertently
    perpetuates a wider variety of plants than
    would otherwise be found on the site.</p>
<p>Selective feeders, prairie dogs put pressure on a particular
    plant species when it becomes most abundant,
    then ignore it almost entirely in favor of another, and
    so on. This cyclic feeding allows each species to recover,
    preventing it from being eliminated.</p>
<p>Dry years help the prairie dog maintain control
    over the vegetation, and thus favor town expansion,
    while wet years speed recovery of the grasses and
    <span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
    work against the town. Towns that had spread into
    lush grassland during the favorable conditions of
    drought may be severely reduced or even eliminated
    with the return of adequate precipitation.</p>
<p>In some cases, the clearing activities of prairie dogs
    may actually speed plant succession. As a direct result
    of overgrazing by domestic stock, much of the
    grassland of the semi-arid West was invaded by sagebrush,
    a tough, drought-resistant plant that tends to
    perpetuate itself indefinitely once introduced. By
    cutting down the sage, prairie dogs eliminate it from
    the plant community and open the land to grasses.</p>
<p>In its struggle for control of territory, the prairie
    dog was aided by the bison. The vast herds that
    moved across the landscape like a black plague of
    giant locusts left choice tracts of the grasslands devastated
    in their wake. The effects of such a physical
    force are difficult for us to comprehend today. Migrating
    northward in huge columns that sometimes
    measured 80 kilometers (50 miles) across, the bison
    cropped and trampled the greening spring grasses.
    Surely when the bison and the prairie dog were finally
    replaced by cattle, the grasslands, free at last
    from such punishment, would flourish. But no, instead
    the grasses languished. How could this be so?</p>
<p>Nature is always more complex than our perception
    of it. For countless centuries the Great Plains
    had survived its many moods of drought, dust storm,
    and wildfire, its scattered plagues of bison and grasshopper.
    Nature knows no “varmits,” and change is
    not catastrophe, but opportunity. But to the settler
    who shot hawks, owls, and eagles to protect his
    calves, poultry, and children, the lesson was a long
    time dawning.</p>
<p>Ironically, the grasslands needed the periodic despoilment
    of bison and burrow. When the bison herd
    moved on, it left behind tons of fertilizer, key to the
    area’s future rejuvenation. But the millions of hoofs
    also left the ground compacted. Were it not for the
    ceaseless activities of countless burrowing animals,
    including the industrious prairie dogs, loosening the
    soil and undoing the damage, the bison would have
    eventually destroyed much of their range.</p>
<p>For an animal so successfully adapted to life on
    the unrelieved expanses of the open plains, it is ironic
    that today prairie dogs survive in isolated colonies
    at the very margins of its desirable habitat.</p>

</div>
<h3 class="interlude" id="c8">Visiting the Park</h3>
<h4 id="ccc8">Location</h4>
<p>On the fringe of the Black
    Hills in northeastern Wyoming, northwest
    of Sundance, northeast of Moorcroft,
    and southwest of Hulett.</p>
<h4 id="ccc9">Area</h4>
<p>545 hectares (1,347 acres).</p>
<h4 id="ccc10">Elevation</h4>
<p>The park is about 1,290
    meters (4,250 feet) above sea level.
    The Tower rises another 264 meters
    (867 feet) to the top.</p>
<h4 id="ccc11">Climate</h4>
<p>Summer temperatures cover
    a wide range from daily highs of 29°C
    (83°F) to lows of 10°C (50°F). Winter
    temperatures plunge below freezing
    for long periods of time. Spring arrives
    usually sometime in April, but the temperature
    drops quickly at night and
    stays cold during the day if it’s cloudy.
    About the end of September, fall begins,
    and with it the golden color of
    changing cottonwood leaves along the
    Belle Fourche River.</p>
<h4 id="ccc12">Best times to visit</h4>
<p>Spring is short in
    the Rocky Mountain West and can be
    a time of violent shifts in weather: summerlike
    days alternating with cold, always
    the possibility of late heavy
    snowfalls, and no inbetweens. These
    extremes seem to be tempered somewhat
    at Devils Tower, and the fun of
    watching deer can more than make up
    for any inconvenience due to the
    weather. Whitetail deer, followed by
    their spotted fawns, are rubbing off
    winter coats. They seem to be browsing
    the park hungrily everywhere you look.</p>
<p>Summer heat, because of elevation and
    dry air, radiates quickly but never becomes
    stifling. Winds are strong and
    steady and there is always a danger of
    exposure for those unprepared for sudden
    <span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
    thunder and lightning storms, or
    for the sudden cooling after sunset.
    Most visits to Devils Tower are made
    in the summer when the surrounding
    rangelands are green and the sparkling
    watercourses invite refreshment under
    shade of cottonwoods.</p>
<p>Early fall, just as the range begins to
    brown, is perhaps a perfect time to be
    at Devils Tower. The park is uncrowded
    after Labor Day. Protected
    meadows are still green. Animals are
    in their prime and ready for the rigors
    of winter. The faint odor of decaying
    vegetation and the foretaste of winter
    on a particularly bracing chill wind—these
    are the pleasures of a long Wyoming
    fall.</p>
<p>Winter brings an air of enforced isolation
    to Devils Tower. Heavy snows
    and frequent blizzard conditions on the
    highways discourage most travelers. A
    rare treat awaits those who do come
    here in winter, however. Bald eagles
    migrate down from the north. You
    might see them wheeling in pairs over
    an otherwise frozen landscape, or making
    a feast of carrion on the ground.</p>
<h4 id="ccc13">Access</h4>
<p>Highways—From Rapid City,
    S. Dak., take I-90 west to Sundance.
    Wyo.; then U.S. 14 to Devils Tower
    Junction; then Wyo. 24 to park. From
    Gillette, Wyo., take I-90 east to Moorcroft,
    then U.S. 14 to Wyo. 24. From
    Newcastle, Wyo. take U.S. 16 to
    Moorcroft. From Belle Fourche, S.
    Dak., take S. Dak. 34 to Wyoming line,
    then Wyo. 24 via Hulett to park.
    Buses—Nearest regularly scheduled
    buses serve Moorcroft; no service to
    park. Railroads—Nearest rail passenger
    service is in Cheyenne. Airport—Rapid
    City Airport is served by a few
    commercial airlines. Cars may be rented.</p>
<h4 id="ccc14">Visitor Center</h4>
<p>For a general introduction
    to Devils Tower, the visitor
    center has exhibits, an audio/visual
    program, trail guides and plant and
    animal checklists, a publications sales
    outlet, and an information counter
    with a ranger on duty to answer questions.
    This is also the place where
    climbers must register to climb Devils
    Tower. The visitor center is open
    from about May 1 to October 31. In
    winter information requests are answered
    in the headquarters administration
    building.</p>
<h4 id="ccc15">Camping</h4>
<p>The park has one campground
    for which a campsite fee is
    charged from about May 20 through
    September 10. Opening and closing
    dates depend on weather conditions.
    It has about 50 camping sites which will
    accommodate both tent and trailer
    camping equipment. A water tap, restrooms,
    fire grills, and picnic tables are
    provided, but there are no utility hook-ups
    for trailers. Campsites are taken
    on a first-come, first-served basis. After
    September 10, or later at the first sign
    of freezing, the water is shut off and
    the road is not snowplowed. Winter
    camping is allowed, however.</p>
<h4 id="ccc16">Scheduled Activities</h4>
<p>The featured
    program at Devils Tower is presented
    every evening during the visitor season
    in the campground amphitheater. The
    story of the nation’s first national monument
    is told with projected slide photographs
    by a park ranger who embellishes
    the story with colorful anecdotes
    about rangering experiences.</p>
<h4 id="ccc17">Hiking</h4>
<p>Even if you have only time for
    a half-day visit to Devils Tower, it’s
    time enough for a hike around the
    tower. Tower Trail is only 2 kilometers
    (1.25 miles) long and traverses fairly
    <span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
    level ground. It stays in forest shade
    while it skirts the jumbled mass of
    boulders lying at the base of the Tower.
    It is the only trail in the park with formal
    wayside markers and benches
    where you can stop and look at the
    Tower from close up.</p>
<p>The park has three other designated
    hiking trails, all of them longer than
    Tower Trail and generally uncrowded.
    Devils Tower is never out of sight for
    long though, so it’s not easy to get lost.
    The longer trails offer a chance to see
    different plant and animal environments;
    open meadows, prairie dog
    towns, bluffs overlooking the Belle
    Fourche River, the riverside habitat
    itself, as well as the pine forest, all of
    which are described in <a class="pginternal" href="#c3">Part 2</a> of this
    handbook.</p>
<h4 id="ccc18">Other accommodations</h4>
<p>Motels, trailer
    courts, camping supply stores, and
    service stations are in the nearby town
    of Hulett. Just outside the park boundary
    is a post office, general store, and
    commercial campground with a few extra
    recreational offerings.</p>
<h4 id="ccc19">Establishment of park</h4>
<p>Proclaimed
    September 24, 1906. Boundary changes,
    August 9, 1955.</p>
<h4 id="ccc20">Mailing address</h4>
<p>Devils Tower, Wyoming 82714.</p>
<h3 class="interlude" id="c9">Park Regulations</h3>
<h4 id="ccc21">Natural Features</h4>
<p>It is unlawful to disturb,
    injure, destroy, or remove any
    vegetation or rocks. This basic rule is
    made not only to protect the natural
    resources but out of consideration for
    others who will be here in the future.</p>
<h4 id="ccc22">Wildlife</h4>
<p>Do not feed the prairie dogs
    or let them get close to you; they carry
    fleas and they can bite you. Do not
    chase, harass, attempt to catch, or feed
    any park animals. Rattlesnakes usually
    don’t strike unless provoked or mistreated.
    Watch out for them! Hunting
    is not permitted in the park. If firearms
    and other weapons are carried, they
    must be unloaded and cased so as to
    prevent their use.</p>
<h4 id="ccc23">Pets</h4>
<p>All pets must be kept in vehicles,
    or caged or leashed when in the park.
    They are not permitted in public buildings.</p>
<h4 id="ccc24">Traffic</h4>
<p>Drive carefully to protect
    yourself, others, and wildlife. Do not
    obstruct traffic by stopping on the
    road; pull over and let other vehicles
    pass. Driving off roadways is prohibited.
    Park on road shoulders or at parking
    areas only.</p>
<h4 id="ccc25">Sanitation</h4>
<p>Camp only at the campground. Dump wastes and wash water
    in special sinks at the restrooms, not
    on the ground. Littering is both irresponsible and unlawful. Trash cans are
    provided at convenient places throughout the park; please use them.</p>
<h4 id="ccc26">Fire Prevention</h4>
<p>Fires are permitted only in the fireplaces found in the
    campground and must not be left unattended.
    Thoroughly drown all campfires with water after use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<h3 class="interlude" id="c10">Climbing the Tower</h3>
<p>All climbers must register by name, address, and telephone number with a
    park ranger before going up.</p>
<p>And you must check out when you return. This is the only safety precaution
    on climbing required by the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. Depending on
    your mountain climbing experience here and elsewhere, however, you
    might want to ask the rangers for safety hints, different climbing routes, and
    conditions on the face of the Tower at the time of your climb.</p>
<p>More than 80 separate routes to the top have been taken and described in
    the literature. No one has been killed climbing the Tower, a remarkable record.
    The most difficult pitches come first while there is still plenty of time
    to turn back or take an easier route. Also, compared to other mountains,
    Devils Tower can be conquered in a short time, less than an hour for the
    most skilled if they use an easy route. This means less chance of exhaustion
    from exposure. In sudden bad weather, one can easily rappel off in 40 to 60
    minutes.</p>

</div>
<p>Records of climbs have been kept at the park since 1937. In 1963 the one
    thousandth climber checked in and in 1970 the two thousandth. Since 1977
    more than 1,000 make the climb every year. The Tower has been climbed with
    the direct aid of ropes and pitons and with a technique known as “free climbing”
    without the use of ropes except as backup to catch a fall. It has been
    climbed from all sides and in all seasons, even on Christmas Day and on
    New Year’s Day. Some people, of course, prefer to climb the Tower in
    <span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
    snow and ice. One might conclude that all the “firsts” have been taken at Devils
    Tower, but, as long as the personal challenge of the sport continues to attract
    newcomers, there are certain to be more new records.</p>

</div>
<p>August has been the most active climbing month in recent years. The heat on
    the south-facing side of the Tower presents serious problems though. Climbers
    usually try to start as early as possible before the sun has a chance to
    heat the rock blazing hot.</p>
<p>Climbers rightfully take interest in the geology of the Tower. Worming their
    fingers into cracks and fissures, depending for their lives on the ringing-hard
    igneous mass that supports them, rock climbers develop a familiarity
    with various origins and kinds of rock. They, of course, contribute to the ongoing
    process of erosion which, over eons of time, has left Devils Tower in
    its present form. The amount of loose rock that breaks off under their feet,
    however, is far less than the amount lost every season from frost-heave, the
    effect of water seeping behind the surface rock and expanding into ice. The
    boulder field at the base of the Tower tells the rest of the erosion story. By
    studying lichen growing on the last slab to fall off the side, it has been estimated
    that this event occurred more than 10,000 years ago.</p>

<h4 id="ccc27"><b>Mount Rushmore National Memorial</b></h4>
<p>is 40 kilometers (25 miles) southwest
    of Rapid City, South Dakota. Patriotic
    ideals representing the birth of the
    Nation through its entry into 20th Century
    world affairs are symbolized in
    massive stone carvings of George
    Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham
    Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt.
    The scale and difficulty of sculptor
    Gutzon Borglum’s achievement perhaps
    can only be appreciated in person.
    From June 1 to Labor Day the faces
    are illuminated at night and evening
    programs are presented in the amphitheater.

<h4 id="ccc28"><b>Wind Cave National Park</b></h4>
<p>is located on
    U.S. 385, 16 kilometers (10 miles)
    north of Hot Springs, South Dakota.
    Wind whistling from the entrance attracted
    attention to the cave, hence its
    name. Jesse McDonald developed the
    cave as a tourist attraction in 1890. His
    son, Alvin, explored its passageways
    and named many of the fancy formations.
    Above ground the park preserves
    a natural prairie environment
    and a remnant bison herd, as poignant
    a scene as you will find anywhere in
    the West. Tours of the cave are conducted
    by park rangers throughout the
    year except on December 25 and January
    1. A campground is open from
    mid-May through mid-September on
    a first-come, first-served basis. Mailing

<h3 class="interlude" id="c12">Not So Nearby National Parks</h3>
<p>A considerable distance from Devils Tower, yet related by geography and
    even history, is a band of national parks not to be overlooked. Yellowstone
    and Grand Teton in northwestern Wyoming, may, in fact, be your
    ultimate destination. The snow-capped peaks of the Bighorn Mountains in
    Wyoming, where Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area is located, can
    be seen from several places along the approach road to Devils Tower. Custer
    Battlefield, adjoining the Crow Indian Reservation, is on the northern route
    to Yellowstone through Billings, Montana. Theodore Roosevelt National
    Park celebrates the man and the ideals of the American conservation movement
    which he accelerated by proclaiming Devils Tower the first national monument.</p>
<h4 id="ccc31"><b>Yellowstone National Park</b></h4>
<p>is on U.S. 89, 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of
    Livingston, Montana. This first and reigning queen of all national parks,
    established more than a century ago, draws travelers as if it were a place of
    pilgrimage. Indeed, there is spiritual enchantment beyond measuring in the
    lively animation of Yellowstone—its exploding geysers, steaming hot pools,
    and dashing waters draining both sides of the continent. Between October 31
    and May 1, park roads and entrances, except the North Entrance, are ordinarily
    closed by snow. Winter activities include snowmobiling and cross-country
    skiing. Campgrounds usually open about June. A host of park-sponsored
    and concessioner services are offered. Mailing address: Yellowstone National
    Park, Wyoming 82190.</p>
<h4 id="ccc32"><b>Grand Teton National Park</b></h4>
<p>is located just north of Jackson, Wyoming, on
    U.S. 187, and 90 kilometers (56 miles) south of Yellowstone via the John D.
    Rockefeller, Jr., Memorial Parkway. The Tetons, among the noblest creations
    in the American West, are a congregation of blue-gray pyramids
    soaring above the sagebrush flats and morainal lakes in Jackson Hole. The
    valley, a hunting ground of prehistoric Indians for centuries, became a fur
    trade crossroads in the early 19th Century. Geology, wildlife, plains Indian
    culture, all share leading roles in the story of this park. Visitor facilities are
    open all year, though curtailed somewhat in winter. Mailing address: Moose,
    Wyoming 83021.</p>
<h4 id="ccc33"><b>Custer Battlefield National Monument</b></h4>
<p>is on Interstate 90, 24 kilometers (15
    miles) south of Hardin, Montana. On Sunday, June 25, 1876, Lt. Col. George
    Armstrong Custer and five companies of the 7th Calvary under his immediate
    command were surrounded and killed by Indians. The defeat shocked the
    nation and still reverberates with questions about what exactly happened in
    this clash of cultures. Memorials spread across the hills soberly tell what little
    is known. The park, open all year, has exhibits but no campgrounds. Mailing
    address: Crow Agency, Montana 59022.</p>
<h4 id="ccc34"><b>Bighorn Canyon National Recreation Area</b></h4>
<p>straddles the Montana-Wyoming
    boundary, 67 kilometers (42 miles) from Hardin, Montana, on the north:
    and at Lovell, Wyoming, on the south. Access to boat launching ramps and
    campgrounds is from either end of the long narrow reservoir backed up behind
    Yellowtail Dam on the Bighorn River, which here flows north. Boating
    and fishing enthusiasts enjoy a long season from mid-April to late October.
    <span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
    Tours of the dam and powerhouse are given daily from Memorial Day to Labor
    Day, and the visitor centers are open all year. Mailing address: P.O.

    A north unit is 90 kilometers (56 miles) north on US. 85. TR’s Maltese
    Cross Cabin is in the south unit, but the park celebrates more than the 26th
    President’s energetic protection of public lands. Magnificently colored
    and worn badlands lie on both sides of the Little Missouri River interspersed
    with grassy ranges where adventurous men, Roosevelt among them, enterprised
    in the open-range cattle business. Populations of bighorn sheep,
    bison, and antelope, among the large game animals once hunted to extinction,
    have been restored. The visiting season is May through October. The
    park has campgrounds in both north and south units. Mailing address:

        Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
        law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
        so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
        States without permission and without paying copyright
        royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
        of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
        Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
        concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
        and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
        the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
        of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
        copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
        easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
        of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
        Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may
        do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
        by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
        license, especially commercial redistribution.

        To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
        distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
        (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
        Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full

        Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
    </div>

    <div>
        1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
        electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
        and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
        (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
        the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
        destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
        possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
        Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
        by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
        or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
        used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
        agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
        things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
        even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
        paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
        Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
        agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
        electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
        Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
        of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
        works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
        States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
        United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
        claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
        displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
        all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
        that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
        free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
        works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
        Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
        comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
        same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
        you share it without charge with others.
    </div>


    <div>
        1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
        what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
        in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
        check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
        agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
        distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
        other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
        representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
        country other than the United States.

        1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
        immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
        prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
        on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
        phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
        performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

            of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online

        </div>
    </blockquote>

    <div>
        1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
        derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
        contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
        copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
        the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
        redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
        Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
        either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
        obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
        trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

        must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
        additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
        will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
        posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
        beginning of this work.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™

        work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
        electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
        prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
        active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
        Gutenberg™ License.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
        compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
        any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
        to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
        other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
        version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
        (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
        to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
        of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
        Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
        full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

    <div>
        1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

        unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
        access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
        provided that:
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
            the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
            you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
            to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
            agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
            Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
            within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
            legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
            payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
            Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
            Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
            Literary Archive Foundation.”
        </li>

        <li>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
            you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
            does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
            License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
            copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
            all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
            works.
        </li>

        <li>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
            any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
            electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
            receipt of the work.
        </li>

        <li>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
            distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <div>
        1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
        Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
        are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
        from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
        the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
        forth in Section 3 below.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.F.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
        effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
        works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
        Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
        electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
        contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
        or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
        intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
        other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
        cannot be read by your equipment.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
        of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
        Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
        Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
        liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
        fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
        LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
        PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
        TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
        LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
        INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
        DAMAGE.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
        defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
        receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
        written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
        received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
        with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
        with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
        lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
        or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
        opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
        the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
        without further opportunities to fix the problem.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
        in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO
        OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
        LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
        warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
        damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
        violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
        agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
        limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
        unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
        remaining provisions.
    </div>

    <div>
        1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
        trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
        providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
        accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
        production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
        electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
        including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
        the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
        or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
        additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
        Defect you cause.

        Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
    </div>

    <div>
        Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
        electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
        computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
        exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
        from people in all walks of life.
    </div>

    <div>
        Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
        assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
        goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
        remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
        and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
        generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
        Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

        Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
    </div>

    <div>
        Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
        public support and donations to carry out its mission of
        increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
        freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
        array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
        ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
        status with the IRS.
    </div>

    <div>
        The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
        charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
        States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
        considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
        with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
        where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
        DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
        visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
    </div>

    <div>
        While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
        have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
        against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
        approach us with offers to donate.

    <div>
        International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
        any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
        outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

    </div>

    <div>
        Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
        Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
        freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
        distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
        volunteer support.
    </div>

    <div>
        Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
        editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
        the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
        necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
        edition.

        Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
        facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
    </div>

    <div>
        This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
        including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
        Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
        subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
